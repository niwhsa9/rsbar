# RS Bar
This is a status bar I have written for DWM. It will support many of my custom widgets including some internet-enabled widgets. This is meant to be run as a systemd service, so it undoubtedly does not adhere to the suckless philosophy ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

### Planned features
- DBus interactions for discord and slack notifs
- Reminders to water my plants via TCP connection to an ESP8266 with capacative moisture probes
- Monitor configuration
- Automatic timezone adjustment
